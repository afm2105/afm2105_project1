              Overall Summary
    To display the questions in the console, I utilized arrays.My
overall approach was to make  simple, easy to understand game that would be enjoyable and be easy for the user to follow. I used alerts after each question to make it easy to follow along
with.


  An unsolved challenge was to reduce the lines of code I had.
An unsolved challenge was to save scores.
